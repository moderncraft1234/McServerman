#### *A web-based GUI for managing Minecraft servers*

I created this because I'm officially annoyed with managing my various servers through the command line. I'm also quarantined for [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) and I am bored.

For now I'm only planning to add support for Vanilla and [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) servers. If there is interest I may add more in the future.

## Roadmap/Todo

- [ ] Download Vanilla JAR
- [ ] Download [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) (Spigot) JAR
- [ ] Whitelist manager
- [ ] GUI `server.properties` editor with explanations/recommended settings
- [ ] Upload/download/backup/restore Worlds
- [ ] Install plugins (Paper/Spigot)
- [ ] Auto port-forward with UPnP (or a guide on port forwarding)
- [ ] Web console with RCON
- [ ] World upgrade for new versions (e.x. 1.14 -> 1.15)
- [ ] Statistics with funky graphs
- [ ] Alerts (shutdown, player join, etc.)
- [ ] System resource monitor
- [ ] Wiki (installation, usage, etc.)
- [ ] Bedrock support
- [ ] Password authentication
- [ ] OAuth authentication (maybe)
- [ ] Snapshot servers
- *I'll update this list with more when I think of new features*

## Limitations

1. Development is slow because I get distracted easily.
